# Building-a-map-using-ranger

Running a simulation in stage to build a map of the surounding from a known initial location. It demonstrates that the surroundings
can be mapped with less error if resolution of the map image is higher.

TODO: Use the map to find the shortest distance between the current position of the robot and the new location, and avoid obastacles
      while navigating.
      Add termaination conditions, which stops the execution once a desired amount of area is mapped.
      
BUGS: Abrupt termination of stage node when the robot is moving.
